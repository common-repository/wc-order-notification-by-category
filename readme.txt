if you want to add more recipients to the new woocommerce order's notification but not want to send every new woocommerce order notification to all. This plugin will help to do that. By using this, you can add email addresses to woocommerce product's categories and when new woocommerce order will be placed on the store, the plugin will go through the all woocommerce order items(products) and get all the categories of order items, at the end find out all the email's related to order item's categories.
